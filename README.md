# simple-chat-app

## Starting the server
node server/index.js

## Starting the client
cd client
npm start

## Usage
There are two users hardcoded into the app. Starting the app and opening it in two tabs will automatically assign user 1 to tab 1 and user 2 to tab 2. You can also change users via the dropdown on the top left corner of the screen. 

There is no persistant storage, so closing a tab will lose that users history.
